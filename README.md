# Weather-Detetcor
A Python Script which uses a REST API to detect the weather of a particular city.

Just visit the Openweathermap API website, register and generate a free API key with the following link:

https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

Copy the generated API key.

Then Open the config.py file and place the API KEY in place of <ENTER API KEY HERE>
 
If all the credentials are entered properly then you can just execute:
  
python3 start.py <CITY NAME>
    
 Or, just python3 start.py
